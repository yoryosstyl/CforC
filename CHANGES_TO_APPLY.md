## Your Changes:

I want to make the following change: I want to add to add a new navbar element that says Συνδεση (Log in) that is a members section only. When users click the log-in page, they go to a page that they can log-in with an email (which is the email already provided) and a password that they create the first time they try to log-in using email verification. When they log-in the log-in navbar item is changed from
Συνδεση to Αποσύνδεση. When Αποσύνδεση is clicked a pop-up appears to verify that the user confirms that and upon confirmation user is logged out and the navbar item turns to Σύνδεση again. The navbar item is totally removed when user is logged out and appear ONLY when the user is succesfully logged in. When the user logs in succesfully, another navbar item appears that says Προφίλ and shows the information about this member that exist in the database. The member is able to edit direction all the information. There should be an obvious button that appears when a change is made that says Αποθήκευση. When button is pressed the updated information is pushed to the database for update, and the button disappears. If more edits are done it appears once more. If user has unsaved information and clicks to another navbar element then a pop-up appears to either reject changes and go to the other page, stay at the page for further edits or save changes and go to the other page.
The profile page should be modern and use directly editting capability e.g. when a text is clicked it can be edited etc.
